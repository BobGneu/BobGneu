ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @BobGneu

Iâ€™m interested in solving technical riddles across many domains
Iâ€™m currently learning about [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [CPP](https://cpp-lang.net/), & [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) 
Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on games, robotics, misc. developer tooling
I'm best reached through email or on discord

I have worked on 
- Games & Game Engines
- Robotics
- Video Streaming
- Architecture & Design of cloud systems
- Tools & Plugins for various platforms
- General Automation & Web Scraping

I enjoy the absolute crap out of performance optimization in the software space.
