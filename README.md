ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @BobGneu

Iâ€™m interested in solving technical riddles across many domains. Iâ€™m currently learning about [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [CPP](https://cpp-lang.net/), & [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). 

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on games, robotics, testing, misc. developer tooling. 

I'm best reached through [email](mailto:bob.chatman+github@gmail.com?subject=[GitHub]%20Good%20day%20from%20your%20profile!y%20from) or on Discord.

I have worked on 
- Games & Game Engines
- Robotics
- Video Streaming
- Architecture & Design of cloud systems
- Tools & Plugins for various platforms
- General Automation & Web Scraping

I enjoy the absolute crap out of performance optimization in the software space.
