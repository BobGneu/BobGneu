👋 Hi, I’m @BobGneu

I’m interested in solving technical riddles across many domains. 

I’m currently solving riddles in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [CPP](https://cpp-lang.net/), & [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). 

I’m looking to collaborate on games, robotics, testing, misc. developer tooling. 
I'm best reached through [email](mailto:bob.chatman+github@gmail.com?subject=[GitHub]%20Good%20day%20from%20your%20profile!y%20from) or on Discord.

I have worked on...
- Games & Game Engines
- Robotics
- Video Streaming
- Architecture & Design of cloud systems
- Tools & plugins for various platforms
- General Automation & Web Scraping

I enjoy the absolute crap out of performance optimization.
